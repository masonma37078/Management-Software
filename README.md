## Brief Introduction

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WeAlumni Management Software is a Windows desktop application based on .NET Framework in C++ language.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is designed for our staffs to manage our members' information and other daily transactions of our organization.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, this software uses SQLite as the local database but will be replaced by a cloud database, in the future, to better support our staffs. 
And synchronize data with another project, WeAlumni WeChat Mini Program, to maintain the data.

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you'd like to leave a feedback or any other comments that you'd like to share, please contact either the IT manager or our organization.
